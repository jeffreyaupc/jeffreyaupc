Hi, I’m Jeffrey Au

I recently finished a data analytics bootcamp at University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies, focusing extensively on data analytics and data visualization skills.<br><br>
I completed my Bachelor's Degree on Business Administration at University of Toronto as well in June 2020, specializing on business management, with topics covering various 
business functions including risk management, marketing, strategic management, human resource management, finance & accounting, etc.<br><br>
I also have professional experience in sales, customer service and business administration.

I’m looking to collaborate on any data ETL process, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!
